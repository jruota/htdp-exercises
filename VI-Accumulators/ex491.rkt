; Does your friendâ€™s solution mean there is no need for our complicated design
; in this motivational section?

; The version with the accumulator uses on the order of n steps where n is the
; number of items in a list.
; This version uses reverse, and if it is similar to reverse-own, reverse uses
; on the order of n^2 [i.e. (* n n)] steps where n is the number of items in the
; list. This would incur a hefty performance deficit compared to the version
; using an accumulator.
