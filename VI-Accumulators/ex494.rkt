; Does the insertion sort> function from Auxiliary Functions that Recur need an
; accumulator? If so, why? If not, why not?

; The first step from 32.1 Recognizing the Need for an Accumulator states

    ; If a structurally recursive function traverses the result of its natural
    ; recursion with an auxiliary, recursive function, consider the use of an
    ; accumulator parameter.

; This is the case here as sort> is a structurally recursive function and the
; auxiliary function insert traverses the result of its natural recursion.

; On the other hand, the accumulator has to use (first some-list) in some way,
; and in the case of sorting this would mean, that it would have to know the
; place of that value in the sorted list before the end of the list, which
; is not feasible. Therefore there is no use for an accumulator in sorting
; algorithms.

; The second step states

;     Our goal must be to understand whether the algorithm can fail to produce
;     a result for inputs for which we expect a result. If so, adding a
;     parameter that accumulates knowledge may help.

; But sorting a list of numbers never fails to deliver a result for
; a fixed-size data list of numbers. Adding another parameter, i.e. the
; accumulator, would therefore not help.
