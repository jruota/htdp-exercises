; DATA DEFINITIONS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

; An FSM is one of:
;   – '()
;   – (cons Transition FSM)
 
(define-struct transition [current next])
; A Transition is a structure:
;   (make-transition FSM-State FSM-State)
 
; FSM-State is a Color.

; A Color is one of: 
; — "white"
; — "yellow"
; — "orange"
; — "green"
; — "red"
; — "blue"
; — "black"
 
; interpretation An FSM represents the transitions that a
; finite state machine can take from one state to another 
; in reaction to keystrokes
