# htdp-exercises
My solutions to the exercises in [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/).

After accidentally deleting all files (up to and including exercise 211) they
will have to be redone. To have a backup in case something like this happens 
again, this repository was created. Let this be a reminder to myself of my 
self-made misery.

The solutions may not be complete, but I did them as best as I could. Also,
because I am redoing the exercises up to exercise 211 (inclusive), the solutions
might use constructs introduced later in the book, although I try to use only
what has been introduced so far.
