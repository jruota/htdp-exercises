# htdp-exercises
My solutions to the exercises in [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/).

After accidentally deleting all files (up to and including exercise 211) they
will have to be redone. To have a backup in case something like this happens 
again, this repository was created. Let this be a reminder to myself of my 
self-made misery.

The solutions may not be complete, but I did them as best as I could. Also,
because I am redoing the exercises up to exercise 211 (inclusive), the solutions
might use constructs introduced later in the book, although I try to use only
what has been introduced so far.

Part of the [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) 
curriculum.

## Missing / Incomplete Exercises
* exercise 224 (incomplete)
* exercise 225
* exercise 277
* ~~exercise 357 – construct an input for eval-definition1 that causes it to run forever~~
* exercise 386 – Google financial services does not supply the necessary data anymore
* exercise 424 – drawn on paper

## Exercises that need to be redesigned
* exercise 472 – the exercise now asks "... whether there is a path between every pair of nodes.",
                 not "... whether there is a path between any pair of nodes." as before.
* exercise 473 – uses exercise 472
